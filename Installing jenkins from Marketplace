Jenkins is an open-source continuous integration environment. 
You can define jobs in Jenkins that can perform tasks such as running a scheduled build of software and backing up data.


The service you are using, Marketplace, is part of Google Cloud. The Jenkins template is developed and maintained by an ecosystem partner named Bitnami.

1]GO to MARKETPLACE 

2Launch Jenkins
3]Verify the deployment, accept the terms and services and click Deploy.

4]You can watch the status as tasks are being performed. Deployment Manager is acquiring a virtual machine instance and installing and configuring software for you. 
You will see jenkins-1 has been deployed when the process is complete.

5]Deployment Manager is a Google Cloud service 
that uses templates written in a combination of YAML, python, and Jinja2 to automate the allocation of Google Cloud resources and perform setup tasks.
 Behind the scenes a virtual machine has been created. A startup script was used to install and configure software, & network Firewall Rules were created to allow traffic to the service.
 
 
 
 6]View the deployment and SSH to the VM
 
 
Shut down and restart the services

7]In the SSH window, enter the following command to shut down all the running services:

-sudo /opt/bitnami/ctlscript.sh stop        ........Refresh the browser window for the Jenkins UI. You will no longer see the Jenkins interface because the service was shut down.


8]In the SSH window, enter the following command to restart the services:

-sudo /opt/bitnami/ctlscript.sh restart
