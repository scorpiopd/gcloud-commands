Create an environment variable and replace [YOUR_REGION] with the region you selected in the previous step:

INFRACLASS_REGION=asia-east2               //use environment variables like this in gcloud commands to reduce the opportunities for typos 





Every time you close Cloud Shell and reopen it, a new VM is allocated, and the environment variable you just set disappears. 
create a file to set the value so that you won't have to enter the command each time Cloud Shell is recycled.
