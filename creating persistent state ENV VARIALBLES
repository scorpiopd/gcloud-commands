Create an environment variable and replace [YOUR_REGION] with the region you selected in the previous step:

-INFRACLASS_REGION=asia-east2               //use environment variables like this in gcloud commands to reduce the opportunities for typos 





Every time you close Cloud Shell and reopen it, a new VM is allocated, and the environment variable you just set disappears. 
create a file to set the value so that you won't have to enter the command each time Cloud Shell is recycled.


1]Create a subdirectory

-mkdir infraclass

2]Create a file called config in the infraclass directory:

-touch infraclass/config

3]Append the value of your Region environment variable to the config file:

-echo INFRACLASS_REGION=$INFRACLASS_REGION >> ~/infraclass/config

4]Create a second environment variable for your Project ID, replacing [YOUR_PROJECT_ID] with your Project ID

-INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID=[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]


5]Append the value of your Project ID environment variable to the config file:

-echo INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID=$INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID >> ~/infraclass/config


6]Use the source command to set the environment variables, and use the echo command to verify that the project variable was set:

source infraclass/config
echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID



you will still need to remember to issue the source command each time Cloud Shell is opened. 
you modify the .profile file so that the source command is issued automatically every time a terminal to Cloud Shell is opened.

7]Close and re-open Cloud Shell. Then issue the echo command again


-echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID          .........There will be no output because the environment variable no longer exists.



8]Modify the bash profile and create persistence
Edit the shell profile with the following command:

-nano .profile

9]Add the following line to the end of the file:

-source infraclass/config

10]Close and then re-open Cloud Shell to recycle the VM.

echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID
